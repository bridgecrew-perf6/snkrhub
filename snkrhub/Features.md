## Concept and features for the app

I want to make Snkrhub a hub for sneaker resellers. The app should be able to track inventory, track existing orders, and create & share listings to buyers.

## App Screens

### Home screen

The home screen will basically be an overview of everthing that is going on. We will have a section that shows inventory analytics like amt of items, total spend, sales income, sales count, and net profit. It will also have a section that shows orders that have been shipped, and deliverd. It will also have another section for analytics for user listings. Refer to Scout account page to see an example.

### Inventory

The inventory tracker will start off with a few features and more will be added later. For now, a user can create a shoe. The creation of an item will be seperated into 2 tabs, the first tab will allow the user to specify the name, brand, color, condition and shoe size. The second tab will be purchase details, the user can specify purchase price, tax, place of purchase, shipping, purchase date, and order number.

The user will also be able to swipe on a shoe to delete it.
