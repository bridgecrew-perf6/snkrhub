## Introduction & overview

Apollo federation allows you to create a gateway that combines multiple GraphQL apis.

In a federated architecture, individual graphql apis are called subgraphs, these subgraphs are then composed into a super grap. By querying the supergraph, clients can query all subgraphs at the same time.

A gateway serves as the public access point for your supergraph. It receives incoming GraphQL operations and distributes them across subgraphs. To clients, this looks exactly the same as querying any other GraphQL serverâ€”no special configuration is required.

## Supergraph schema composition

To create a supergraph, you use a process called composition. Composition takes all of your subgraph schemas and combines them into one schema for your gateway.

As a best practise, the gateway does not compose its own supergraph schema. Instead, a separate process composes the schema and provides it to the gateway. This helps improve reliability and reduce downtime when you make changes to a subgraph.

To create a gateway, refer to this: [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/quickstart/setup#2-create-a-new-gateway-project](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/quickstart/setup#2-create-a-new-gateway-project)

## Federated Schemas

### Overview

- Subgraph schemas. Each subgraph has a distinct schema that indicates which types and fields of your composed supergraph it can resolve.

  - These are the only schemas that you can define manually.

- Supergraph schema. This schema combines all of the types and fields from your subgraph schemas, plus some Federation-specific information that tells your gateway which subgraphs can resolve which fields.

  - This schema is the result of performing composition on your collection of subgraph schemas.

- API schema. This schema is like the supergraph schema, but it omits types, fields, and directives that are considered "machinery" and are not part of your public API (this includes Federation-specific information).
  - This is the schema that your gateway exposes to clients, who don't need to know internal implementation details about your graph.

For more info on Subgraph Schemas, refer to: [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/overview#subgraph-schemas](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/overview#subgraph-schemas)

### Schema composition

Composition is the process of combining a set of subgraph schemas into a supergraph schema.

To compose a supergraph schema, check these docs: [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/composition#manually-with-the-rover-cli](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/composition#manually-with-the-rover-cli)

#### Rules of composition

In Federation 2, subgraph schemas must follow all of these rules to successfully compose into a supergraph schema:

- Multiple subgraphs can't define the same field on an object type, unless that field is shareable.

- A shared field must have both a compatible return type and compatible argument types across each defining subgraph.

- If multiple subgraphs define the same type, each field of that type must be resolvable by every valid GraphQL operation that includes it.
  - This rule is the most complex and the most essential to Federation 2. More info here: [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/composition#unresolvable-field-example](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/composition#unresolvable-field-example)
